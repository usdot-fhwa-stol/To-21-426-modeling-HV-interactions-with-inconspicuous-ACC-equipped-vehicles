# Summary
This repository contains the source code of calibrating IDM model for human-driven vehicles (HVs) when they follow HVs and when they follow Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) – equipped vehicles. 
The source code was developed to obtain the IDM parameters of HVs under the two following scenarios. Based on the calibrated results, the relationships between IDM parameters when HVs follow HVs and ACC-equipped 
vehicles are determined.

# Project Description
The project title is Developing Improved Analysis, Modeling, and Simulation Tools for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Automated Driving System Applications. The majority of existing AMS tools were 
primarily built to model human driver behavior in the environment that consists of only human-driven vehicles (HVs). This design focus makes them less effective at mimicking automated driving behavior or 
simulating interactions between HVs and AVs. Without these dedicated resources, the tools risk estimating the impacts of ADAS and ADS technologies on traffic flow. Therefore, before these tools can be used 
for accurate simulation study, it is necessary that the current AMS tools evolve to incorporate the complexities of ADAS and ADS capabilities. To achieve this objective, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) 
launched this project with the goal of enhancing current AMS tools to improve modeling for ADAS and ADS applications. The majority of existing AMS tools were primarily built to model human driver in the environment 
that consists of only human-driven vehicles (HVs). This design focus on makes them less effective at mimicking automated driving behavior or simulating interactions between HVs and AVs.

## Testing
### Car-following model calibration
Step 1: Open Jupyter notebook in Anoconda\
Step 2: Upload the file “PSO algorithm for calibration” in the folder of "calibration code" onto your Jupyter notebook.\
Step 3: If you’d like to obtain parameters for the scenario of HVs following HVs, you need to set “CAV_judge = False” in the code. If you’d like to obtain parameters for the scenario of HVs following ACC-equipped vehicles, you need to set “CAV_judge= True” in the code.\
Step 4: After setting this parameter, click “Run” under kernel to run each block continuously or click “Restart & Run all” under kernel to run all the blocks all the time. After running the code, the parameters of the car-following model for each vehicle will be saved in the folder of parameter.
